# 7-Segment-Display-Group-Project
7 Segment Display Group Project, Our task was to make an excess-3 binary to 7 segment display with only NAND gates, however we could not have more then 16 gates, and no gate could have more than 4 inputs
I was lead the group and was in charge of reducing the gates, and progarmming and setting up the hardware demonstration.
Here is a link to the video of it working: https://youtu.be/Snd675wRvoo
