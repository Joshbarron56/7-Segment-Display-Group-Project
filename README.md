7 Segment Display Group Project, Our task was to make an excess-3 binary to 7 segment display with only NAND gates, however we could not have more than 16 gates, and no gate could have more than 4 inputs I was lead the group and was in charge of reducing the gates, and programming and setting up the hardware demonstration.
